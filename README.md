# A Sandman fan comic (8 x 9 panels)

In 1998, 5-6 people that were active in the newsgroup alt.fan.neil-gaiman (aka alt.fan.thingie) wrote a fan fiction comic set in the Sandman universe. The initiative came from a person called Adeheathen. The original comic was presented to Neil Gaiman at some point.

I discovered the (final?) illustrations as JPG's in an old mailbox, and I think these are worth preserving.

The copyright is quite unknown, but everything Sandman is &copy; DC Comics as usual, and the drawing are by Adeheathen.

The names of the script authors are hidden in the panels.
