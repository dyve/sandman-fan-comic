# A Sandman fan comic (8 x 9 panels)

In 1998, 5-6 people that were active in the newsgroup alt.fan.neil-gaiman (aka alt.fan.thingie) wrote a fan fiction comic set in the Sandman universe. The initiative came from a person called Adeheathen. The original work was presented to Neil Gaiman at some point.

I discovered the (final?) illustrations as JPG's in an old mailbox, and I think these are worth preserving. The date of the e-mail is Oct 27, 1998, and the message from Adeheathen reads:

> At long last, here are the Dreaming story parts 1 to 8.
> I think its turned out alright !
> See if you can spot all the guest stars !
> The pics view okay in Paintbrush Pro, and the usual image viewers.
> 
> (PS at the time of writing this e-mail, I can't find "Prodigal's" address, so
> if anyone knows it, please forward it)
