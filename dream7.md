Top row, panel 1 of 3:

Caption (top): I dreamed I saw an angel.

We see Fiddler’s Green (the place, not Gilbert), trees, flowers, everything. In the middle of it, we see an angel (drawn like Duma and Remiel, dressed in white, wings, hovering just above the floor), the most radiant angel you could ever imagine. He should almost be too bright to look at. I do not see the face of the angel, he has his back turned towards me.

Top row, panel 2 of 3:

The angel has not turned halfway towards me, but does not look at me. The angel speaks, apparently to no one. “So this is what they thought it would be. The sailors. This is where they hoped they would go when they drowned.”

Top row, panel 3 of 3:

Gilbert now appears, looking rather vague (not completely physically present, more like a shade). 
Gilbert: “Yes. And they would not like it if they saw you here. Hoom. I am not sure I like to see you here myself.”

Second row, panel 1 of 3

Angel: “I am not me. I am a dream of myself. How else could I appear like this?”
Gilbert. “Ah. That was indeed going to be my next question. The fact that you are a dream explains why I recognized you in this form. Hoom. We have company, by the way.”

Second row, panel 2 of 3:

Gilbert and the angel both look at me. The angel’s eyes are burning with the brightest light.
Angel: “I see.”
Angel: “Tell me, are you a sailor?” 

Second row, panel 3 of 3:

I answer: “No.” (second text balloon)  “Am I dead?“

Third row, panel 1 of 3:

Angel (laughing): “No you are not. Trust me, when you die, you will know it. You are dreaming.”
I: “I dreamed I saw an angel”

Third row, panel 2 of 3

The angel is closer now, so close that I can still see Fiddler’s Green around him but Gilbert no longer. It should be obvious that he is approaching me. The angel is smiling, showing great happiness on his face.
Angel: “Yes you did. And you will remember this when you wake. You dreamt you saw an angel.”

 Third row, panel 3 of 3:

We see an extreme close-up of the angel’s face, he is looking down, his eyes almost shut, as if he is ashamed.

Caption (top): The angel kissed me gently on the forehead.

Angel: “Go now, with my blessing. And thank you. For not guessing my name.”

Note: The features of the angel should of course bear are striking resemblance to Lucifer, as he was drawn in Sandman. I thought I’d not mention it before the last panel, some people might enjoy reading it like this.
